# Theory:

1️⃣ What is C (in theory)?

C is a procedural, compiled programming language.

That means:

You tell the computer step-by-step instructions

The instructions are compiled (translated) into machine language before running

The computer executes them directly and fast

C sits close to hardware, which is why it’s used for:

Operating systems

Device drivers

Embedded systems

Efficiency and Portability

C is an efficient language

takes advantage of the capabilities of current computers

C programs are compact and fast (similar to assembly language programs)

programmers can fine-tune their programs for maximum speed or most efficient use of memory

######

C is a portable language

C programs written on one system can be run on other systems with little or no modification

a leader in portability

compilers are available for many computer architectures

There are four fundamental tasks in the creation of any C program

Editing

Compiling

Linking

Executing

These tasks will become second nature to you because you will be doing it so often

The processes of editing, compiling, linking, and executing are essentially the same for developing programs in any environment and with any compiled language

Editing is the process of creating and modifying your C source code

source code is inside a file and contains the program instructions you write

choose a wise name for your base file name (all source files end in the .c extension)

we will use an IDE (Code::Blocks) for this class, but you can use any editor (Notepad, etc.) to create your source code

##########################################################

#Compiling:

A compiler converts your source code into machine language and detects and reports errors in your code

The input to the compiler is the file you produce during your editing (source file)

Compilation is a two-stage process

the first stage is called the preprocessing phase, during which your code may be modified or added to

the second stage is the actual compilation that generates the object code

The compiler examines each program statement and checks it to ensure that it conforms to the syntax and semantics of the language

can also recognize structural errors (dead code)

does not find logic errors

typical errors reported might be due to an expression that has unbalanced parentheses (syntactic error), or due to the use of a variable that is not “defined” (semantic error)


Compiling (cont’d)

After all errors are fixed, the compiler will then take each statement of the program and translate it into assembly language

The compiler will then translate the assembly language statements into actual machine instructions

the output from the compiler is known as object code and it is stored in files called object files (same name as source file with a .obj or .o extension)

The standard command to compile your C programs will be cc (or the GNU compiler, which is gcc)

cc -c myprog.c or gcc -c myprog.c

if you omit the -c flag, your program will automatically be linked as well





######################################################

Linking

After the program has been translated into object code, it is ready to be linked

The purpose of the linking phase is to get the program into a final form for execution on the computer

linking usually occurs automatically when compiling depending on what system you are on, but can sometimes be a separate command

The linker combines the object modules generated by the compiler with additional libraries needed by the program to create the whole executable

also detects and reports errors

if part of your program is missing or a nonexistent library component is referenced


Linking (cont’d)

A failure during the linking phase means that once again you have to go back and edit your source code

Success will produce an executable file

In a Windows environment, the executable file will have an .exe extension

in UNIX / Linux, there will be no such extension (a.out by default)

Many IDEs have a build option, which will compile and link your program in a single operation to produce the executable

A program of any significant size will consist of several source code files

each source code file needs the compiler to generate the object file that need to be linked

The program is much easier to manage by breaking it up into a number of smaller source files

It is cohesive and makes the development and maintenance of the program a lot easier

the set of source files that make up the program will usually be integrated under a project name, which is used to refer to the whole program


##################################################

Executing

In most IDEs, you’ll find an appropriate menu command that allows you to run or execute your compiled program

Otherwise double-click the .exe file or type a.out on the console in Linux manually

The execution stage is where you run your program

each of the statements of the program is sequentially executed in turn

if the program requests any data from the user, the program temporarily suspends its execution so that the input can be entered

results that are displayed by the program (output) appear in a window called the console

This stage can also generate a wide variety of error conditions

producing the wrong output

just sitting there and doing nothing

crashing your computer

If the program does not perform the intended functionality, then it will be necessary to go back and reanalyze the program’s logic

known as the debugging phase, correct all the known problems or bugs from the program

will need to make changes to the original source program

the entire process of compiling, linking, and executing the program must be repeated until the desired results are obtained
