#Variables and Memory:

Overview

Remember that a program needs to store the instructions of its program and the data that it acts upon while your computer is executing that program

This information is stored in memory (RAM)

RAM’s contents are lost when the computer is turned off

Hard drives store persistent data

You can think of RAM as an ordered sequence of boxes

the box is full when it represents 1 or the box is empty when it represents 0

each box represents one binary digit, either 0 or 1 (true and false)

each box is called a bit

bits in memory are grouped into sets of eight (byte)

each byte has been labeled with a number (address)

the address of a byte uniquely references that byte in your computer’s memory

Again, memory consists of a large number of bits that are in groups of eight (called bytes) and each byte has a unique address

Variables

The true power of programs you create is their manipulation of data

So, we need to understand the different data types you can use, as well as how to create and name variables

Constants are types of data that do not change and retain their values throughout the life of the program

Variables are types of data that may change or be assigned values as the program runs

Variables are the names you give to computer memory locations which are used to store values in a computer program

For example, assume you want to store two values 10 and 20 in your program and at a later stage, you want to use these two values

Create variables with appropriate names

Store your values in those two variables

Retrieve and use the stored values from the variables
