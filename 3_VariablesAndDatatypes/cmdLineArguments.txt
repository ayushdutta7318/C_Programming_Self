Overview

There are times when a program is developed that requires the user to enter a small amount of information at the terminal.

This information might consist of a number indicating the triangular number that you want to have calculated or a word that you want to have looked up in a dictionary.

Two ways of handling this

Requesting the data from the user

Supply the information to the program at the time the program is executed (command-line arguments)

We know that the main() function is a special function in C

Entry point of the program

When main() is called by the runtime system, two arguments are actually passed to the function

The first argument (argc for argument count) is an integer value that specifies the number of arguments typed on the command line

The second argument (argv for argument vector) is an array of character pointers (strings)
