Char

Chars represent a single character such as the letter ‘a’, the digit character ‘6’, or a semicolon (‘;’)

Character literals use single quotes such as ‘A’ or ‘Z’

You can also declare char variables to be unsigned

can be used to explicitly tell the compiler that a particular variable is a signed quantity

We will talk about a character string in another lecture, much different than a single character

Declaring a char
char broiled;        /* declare a char variable */
broiled = 'T';       /* OK */
broiled = T;         /* NO! Thinks T is a variable */
broiled = "T";       /* NO! Thinks "T" is a string */


If you omit the quotes, the compiler thinks that T is the name of a variable

If you use double quotes, it thinks you are using a string

You can also use the numerical code to assign values

char grade = 65;     /* ok for ASCII, but poor style */

Escape Characters

C contains special characters that represent actions

backspacing

going to the next line

making the terminal bell ring (or speaker beep)

We can represent these actions by using special symbol sequences

called escape sequences

Escape sequences must be enclosed in single quotes when assigned to a character variable

char x = '\n';


and then print the variable x to advance the printer or screen one line
