#Datatypes in C:

Overview

We understand that C supports many different types of variables and each type of variable is used for storing kind of data

types that store integers

types that store noninteger numerical values

types that store characters

Some examples of basic data types in C are:

int
float
double
char
_Bool


the difference between the types is in the amount of memory they occupy and the range of values they can hold

the amount of storage that is allocated to store a particular type of data

depends on the computer you are running (machine-dependent)

an integer might take up 32 bits on your computer, or perhaps it might be stored in 64 bits.

#int

a variable of type int can be used to contain integral values only (values that do not contain decimal places)

a minus sign preceding the data type and variable indicates that the value is negative

the int type is a signed integer

it must be an integer and it can be positive, negative, or zero

if an integer is preceded by a zero and the letter x (either lowercase or uppercase), the value is taken as being expressed in hexadecimal (base 16) notation

int rgbColor = 0xFFEF0D;

the values 158, -10, and 0 are all valid examples of integer constants

no embedded spaces are permitted between the digits

values larger than 999 cannot be expressed using commas (12,000 must be written as 12000)

#float

A variable to be of type float can be used for storing floating-point numbers (values containing decimal places)

the values 3., 125.8, and -.0001 are all valid examples of floating-point constants that can be assigned to a variable

floating-point constants can also be expressed in scientific notation

1.7e4 is a floating-point value expressed in this notation and represents the value 1.7 × 10⁴

#double

the double type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice the precision

used whenever the range provided by a float variable is not sufficient

can store twice as many significant digits

most computers represent double values using 64 bits

all floating-point constants are taken as double values by the C compiler

to explicitly express a float constant, append either an f or F to the end of the number

#_Bool

the _Bool data type can be used to store just the values 0 or 1

used for indicating an on/off, yes/no, or true/false situation (binary choices)

_Bool variables are used in programs that need to indicate a Boolean condition

a variable of this type might be used to indicate whether all data has been read from a file

0 is used to indicate a false value

1 indicates a true value

#Other Data Types

the int type will probably meet most of your integer needs when beginning in C

however, C offers many other integer types

gives the programmer the option of matching a type to a particular use case

integer types vary in the range of values offered and in whether negative numbers can be used

C offers three adjective keywords to modify the basic integer type (can also be used by itself)

short, long, and unsigned

the type short int, or short, may use less storage than int, thus saving space when only small numbers are needed

can be used when the program needs a lot of memory and the amount of available memory is limited

the type long int, or long, may use more storage than int, thus enabling you to express larger integer values

the type long long int, or long long, may use more storage than long

a constant value of type long int is formed by optionally appending the letter L (upper- or lowercase) onto the end of an integer constant

long int numberOfPoints = 131071100L;



Type specifiers can also be applied to doubles

long double US_deficit_2017;

A long double constant is written as a floating constant with the letter l or L immediately following

1.234e+7L

The type unsigned int, or unsigned, is used for variables that have only nonnegative values (positive)

unsigned int counter;

the accuracy (range) of the integer variable is extended

The keyword signed can be used with any of the signed types to make your intent explicit

short, short int, signed short, and signed short int are all names for the same type
