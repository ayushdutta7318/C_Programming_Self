#Enums

a data type that allows a programmer to define a variable and specify the valid values that could be stored into that variable

can create a variable named “myColor” and it can only contain one of the primary colors, red, yellow, or blue, and no other values

you first have to define the enum type and give it a name

initiated by the keyword enum

then the name of the enumerated data type

then a list of identifiers (enclosed in a set of curly braces) that define the permissible values that can be assigned to the type

enum primaryColor { red, yellow, blue };


variables declared to be of this data type can be assigned the values red, yellow, and blue inside the program, and no other values.

Enums (cont’d)

To declare a variable to be of type enum primaryColor

use the keyword enum

followed by the enumerated type name

followed by the variable list

enum primaryColor myColor, gregsColor;


defines the two variables myColor and gregsColor to be of type primaryColor

the only permissible values that can be assigned to these variables are the names red, yellow, and blue

myColor = red;

Another example:

enum month { 
    January, February, March, April, May, June, 
    July, August, September, October, November, December 
};

Enums as ints

the compiler actually treats enumeration identifiers as integer constants

the first name in the list is 0

enum month thisMonth;
...
thisMonth = February;


the value 1 is assigned to thisMonth (and not the name February) because it is the second identifier listed inside the enumeration list

if you want to have a specific integer value associated with an enumeration identifier, the integer can be assigned to the identifier when the data type is defined

enum direction { up, down, left = 10, right };


an enumerated data type direction is defined with the values up, down, left, and right

up = 0 because it appears first in the list

down = 1 because it appears next

left = 10 because it is explicitly assigned this value

right = 11 because it appears immediately after left in the list
