# Indirection:

Indirection

pointers are very similar to the concept of indirection that you employ in your everyday life

suppose you need to buy a new ink cartridge for your printer

all purchases are handled by the purchasing department

you call Joe in purchasing and ask him to order the new cartridge for you

Joe then calls the local supply store to order the cartridge

you are not ordering the cartridge directly from the supply store yourself (indirection)

in programming languages, indirection is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container, instead of the value itself

the most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its memory address

a pointer provides an indirect means of accessing the value of a particular data item

a variable whose value is a memory address

its value is the address of another location in memory that can contain a value

Why use pointers?

accessing data by means of only variables is very limiting

with pointers, you can access any location (you can treat any position of memory as a variable, for example) and perform arithmetic with pointers

pointers in C make it easier to use arrays and strings

pointers allow you to refer to the same space in memory from multiple locations

means that you can update memory in one location and the change can be seen from another location in your program

can also save space by being able to share components in your data structures

pointers allow functions to modify data passed to them as variables

pass by reference – passing arguments to a function in a way they can be changed by the function

uses less memory: useful for embedded systems

Dynamic memory can be allocated at runtime.

allows to develop complex data structure.

pointers provide access to memory.
