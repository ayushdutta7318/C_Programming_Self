Type Conversions

Conversion of data between different types can happen automatically (implicit conversion) by the language or explicitly by the program.

To effectively develop C programs, you must understand the rules used for the implicit conversion of floating-point and integer values in C.

Normally, you shouldn’t mix types, but there are occasions when it is useful.

Remember: C is flexible and gives you freedom, but do not abuse it.

Whenever a floating-point value is assigned to an integer variable in C, the decimal portion of the number gets truncated.

int x = 0;
float f = 12.125;

x = f;   // value stored in x is the number 12, only the int portion is stored

Type Conversion (cont’d)

Assigning an integer variable to a floating-point variable does not cause any change in the value of the number.

The value is converted by the system and stored in the floating-point variable.

When performing integer arithmetic

If two operands in an expression are integers, then any decimal portion resulting from a division operation is discarded, even if the result is assigned to a floating-point variable.

Mixed-type expressions

If one operand is an int and the other is a float, then the operation is performed as a floating-point operation.
