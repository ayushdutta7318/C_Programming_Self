Overview

C offers bitwise logical operators and shift operators

look something like the logical operators you saw earlier but are quite different

operate on the bits in integer values

Not used in the common program

One major use of the bitwise AND (&) and the bitwise OR (|) is in operations to test and set individual bits in an integer variable

can use individual bits to store data that involve one of two choices

You could use a single integer variable to store several characteristics of a person

store whether the person is male or female with one bit

use three other bits to specify whether the person can speak French, German, or Italian

another bit to record whether the person’s salary is $50,000 or more

in just four bits you have a substantial set of data recorded
