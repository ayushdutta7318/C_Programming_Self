sizeof Operator

You can find out how many bytes are occupied in memory by a given type by using the sizeof operator.

sizeof is a special keyword in C.

sizeof is actually an operator, not a function.

It is evaluated at compile time, not at runtime, unless a variable-length array (VLA) is used in its argument.

The argument to the sizeof operator can be:

a variable

an array name

the name of a basic data type

the name of a derived data type

an expression

sizeof(int) will result in the number of bytes occupied by a variable of type int.

You can also apply the sizeof operator to an expression.

The result is the size of the value that results from evaluating the expression.

Use the sizeof operator wherever possible to avoid having to calculate and hard-code sizes into your program.
