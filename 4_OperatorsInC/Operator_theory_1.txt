Overview

Operators are functions that use a symbolic name

perform mathematical or logical functions

Operators are predefined in C, just like they are in most other languages, and most operators tend to be combined with the infix style

A logical operator (sometimes called a “Boolean operator”) is an operator that returns a Boolean result that’s based on the Boolean result of one or two other expressions

An arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them

Other operators include assignment, relational (<, >, !=), bitwise (<<, >>, ~)

Expressions and Statements:

Statements form the basic program steps of C, and most statements are constructed from expressions.

An expression consists of a combination of operators and operands.

Operands are what an operator operates on.

Operands can be constants, variables, or combinations of the two.

Every expression has a value.

Examples of expressions:

Examples of expressions:
-6
4 + 21
a * (b + c / d) / 20
q = 5 * 2
x = ++q % 3
q > 3


Expressions and Statements (cont’d)

Statements are the building blocks of a program (declaration)

A program is a series of statements with special syntax ending with a semicolon (simple statements)

A complete instruction to the computer

Declaration statement:

int Jason;


Assignment statement:

Jason = 5;


Function call statement:

printf("Jason");


Structure statement:

while (Jason < 20) Jason = Jason + 1;


Return statement:

return 0;


C considers any expression to be a statement if you append a semicolon (expression statements)

So, 8; and 3-4; are perfectly valid in C

Compound Statements

Two or more statements grouped together by enclosing them in braces (block)

int index = 0;
while (index < 10)
{
    printf("hello");
    index = index + 1;
}
