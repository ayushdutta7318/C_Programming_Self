#Pre Processor rin C:

Overview

another unique feature of the C language that is not found in many other higher-level programming languages

allows for programs to be easier to develop, easier to read, easier to modify, and easier to port to different computer systems

part of the C compilation process that recognizes special statements

analyzes these statements before analysis of the C program itself takes place

an instruction to your compiler to do something before compiling the source code

could be anywhere in your code

If you want it formatted differently (plain paragraph, notes, or slides), let me know.

Identified by # sign:
Eg:
#include


Overview (cont’d)

Preprocessor statements are identified by the presence of a pound sign, #, which must be the first non-space character on the line

Our first “challenge” used a preprocessor directive, specifically the #include directive

We will utilize the preprocessor to:

create our own constants and macros with the #define statement

build your own library files with the #include statement

make more powerful programs with the conditional #ifdef, #endif, #else, and #ifndef statements
